# Celestaisle

## Description
Celestaisle is a mobile app that helps customers optimize their grocery shopping experience. Users can locate their local store, import a grocery list, and receive AI-generated product recommendations that fit their budget. If the user has remaining budget room, the app suggests complementary items and even a personalized sweet or salty treat.

As users build their lists, Celestaisle updates totals in real time and generates the most efficient route through the store to minimize shopping time. The project also integrated the FreeWili hardware device (provided by MHacks) to enhance the in-store experience, allowing store employees to locate and assist customers directly.

## Contribution
I developed the backend infrastructure for Celestaisle, including:
- A simulated database of grocery stores, items, and prices
- A socket-based clientâ€“server communication system for transferring store maps to the FreeWili device
This work focused on scalable server design, real-time data exchange, and embedded system communication within a multi-component architecture.
