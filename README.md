# Celestaisle

## Description

Using this mobile app, customers can find their local store and import their grocery list to receive suggestions on the best
products for their budget. If a customer's budget has been met with some wiggle room, Celestaisle will recommend grocery store items 
that best match or go with the current items on your grocery list, plus a sweet/salty treat to go with their items. Having this AI 
generated suggest items list, a customer can then add them to their actual grocery list and see their total update in real time.
Additionally, once the grocery list has been confirmed, the best route through the store will be generated and displayed to aid hurried 
shoppers get in and out without lingering too long finding their items. This project also used the FreeWili hardware device provided to use 
by MHACKS to aid in our grocery store employee-customer service implementation, where employees can find customers and help them should they have 
any questions.
